# Blockhain-Enove
A new blockchain, proof-of-work, with open source. Help us spread awareness and increase network security.
Summary of Blockchain Functionality
Data Structure:

The blockchain consists of blocks, each containing a set of transactions, a hash of the previous block, a timestamp, a nonce, and a miner (the entity that mined the block).
Mining:

Mining is the process of solving a computational problem (proof of work) to add new blocks to the blockchain. Each mined block rewards the miner with coins.
Difficulty and Reward:

Mining difficulty increases over time to maintain a fixed interval between blocks (e.g., 10 minutes). The reward per block decreases after a certain number of blocks have been mined (e.g., every 210,000 blocks).
Transactions:

Users can conduct transactions, which are recorded in the blocks. The system ensures that transactions are secure and verifiable.
Security:

The blockchain uses cryptography to protect information and ensure data integrity. Once a block is added, it cannot be altered without reverting all subsequent blocks.
Visibility and Transparency:

All data in the blockchain, including transactions and miners, is visible to all participants in the network, promoting transparency.
Wallets and Addresses:

Users have wallets that contain public and private keys. Transactions are made using the recipient's public key and require the sender's private key for authentication.
P2P Network:

The blockchain operates on a decentralized network, where each node maintains a copy of the blockchain, ensuring there is no single point of failure.
Conclusion
This system creates a secure and transparent environment for digital transactions, similar to Bitcoin, allowing users to mine, send, and receive coins reliably. If you need more details on any specific part, just let me know!
